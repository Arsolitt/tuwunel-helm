# Cut a release tag: the only way a release happens. The tag carries the
# version, so nothing in the repository is bumped by hand - the release job
# stamps it into the packaged chart (`helm package --version`) and records it in
# `charts/tuwunel/Chart.yaml` on main afterwards.
#
#   hack/release.sh <version>            e.g. 2.1.0 or 2.1.0-rc.1
#   hack/release.sh --check <version>    validate only, print the release facts
#
# Two tracks, two shapes, nothing else - a version is either
#   <major>.<minor>.<patch>            the stable track
#   <major>.<minor>.<patch>-rc.<n>     the release candidate track
# and the track decides the rest: a candidate is a GitHub pre-release, it is
# never "Latest", and its release body is the `## [<major>.<minor>.<patch>]`
# section of CHANGELOG.md - write the section for the version you will ship,
# then cut candidates of it.
#
# <version> may carry the chart's tag prefix (`tuwunel-2.1.0-rc.1`); the release
# job passes `$GITHUB_REF_NAME` straight through.
#
# --check prints, on stdout and only on success, the four facts the release job
# turns into step outputs (`key=value` lines, appended to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`):
#
#   version=2.1.0-rc.1
#   channel=rc
#   section=2.1.0
#   tag=tuwunel-2.1.0-rc.1
#
# Checks, in order - each one exits before anything is created:
#   1. the version has one of the two shapes above;
#   2. CHANGELOG.md carries the section the release body comes from
#      (hack/release-notes.sh is the reader, so the rule the release job applies
#      is the rule this checks);
# and, in the releasing form only:
#   3. the working tree is clean;
#   4. HEAD is the tip of origin/main - the tag is cut from what main serves;
#   5. the tag does not exist, locally or on origin.
#
# Exit codes: 0 success; 1 a precondition failed; 2 usage or version shape.
#
# Needs bash and git.
