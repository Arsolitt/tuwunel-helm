#
# Print the GitHub release body for one release: the `## [<section version>]`
# section of CHANGELOG.md, plus a compare link when the tags can be resolved.
#
# The `release` job in .github/workflows/ci.yaml runs this once per tag it has
# just published (`hack/release-notes.sh <version> <section version>`) and pipes
# the output into `gh release edit <tag> --notes-file`; `hack/release.sh` runs it
# in `--check` mode, before a tag exists, because a missing section has to fail
# there rather than in the release job after the gates.
#
# The version and the section are two arguments because the two tracks read
# CHANGELOG.md differently: a stable release `2.1.0` publishes `## [2.1.0]`,
# while a candidate `2.1.0-rc.1` publishes the section of the version it is a
# candidate of, `## [2.1.0]` - the section is written once per version and the
# candidates of it share it.
#
# The section *is* the release body, which is what keeps the notes in the
# repository and the notes on the GitHub release from drifting apart: editing
# CHANGELOG.md is how release notes are written, nothing is generated from
# commit messages.
#
#   1. locate the section for <section version> - from the `## [<version>]`
#      heading up to (excluding) the next `## ` heading, with leading and
#      trailing blank lines trimmed. A version whose heading is absent exits
#      non-zero and prints nothing: the release job must go red, not publish a
#      release whose body silently stayed the chart description;
#   2. print the section;
#   3. append the `**Full Changelog**: <compare URL>` line when the repository,
#      the `<chart name>-<version>` tag and a previous `<chart name>-*` tag are
#      all resolvable. The previous tag follows the release's own track - a
#      candidate compares against the tag that preceded it, a stable release
#      against the previous stable one, so its compare range is the whole line
#      and not just what changed since the last candidate. That part is best
#      effort: any of them missing just means the section is printed alone,
#      still with exit 0.
#
# usage: hack/release-notes.sh <version> [<section-version>]   (e.g. 2.0.0, or
#                                              2.1.0-rc.1 2.1.0 for a candidate)
#        CHANGELOG_FILE=<path>                 (default: CHANGELOG.md at the repo root,
#                                               resolved from this script's own location
#                                               rather than from $PWD; set for tests)
